# C---Programming-Language
Welcome to the C Programming Language repository! This repo contains a collection of C programs ranging from beginner-level concepts to more advanced concepts. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to learn or brush up on C fundamentals.
# ðŸ“Œ About C Language
The C programming language has a rich history rooted in the development of operating systems and software systems that shaped modern computing.

ðŸ”¹ Origin and Development
1969â€“1973: C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs (AT&T).
It evolved from two earlier languages:
BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) â€“ developed by Martin Richards.
B â€“ developed by Ken Thompson, a simplified version of BCPL.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose of Creation
C was designed as a system programming language to implement the UNIX operating system.

It offered low-level memory access, structured programming, and efficient performance â€“ ideal for writing operating system code.
Legacy and Impact
C influenced many modern programming languages including:
C++, Java, C#, Objective-C, Rust, and Go.

It remains a foundational language taught in computer science education and widely used in:
Embedded systems
System-level programming
Compilers and interpreters
Game development
IoT and firmware
